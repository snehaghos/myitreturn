      <h2>Understanding Cryptocurrency Income</h2>
      <p>Cryptocurrency income includes any gains from trading, mining, staking, or receiving crypto as payment. The IRS treats cryptocurrency as property, not currency.</p>
      
      <h2>Types of Crypto Income</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Capital Gains:</strong> Profit from selling crypto at a higher price than purchase</li>
        <li><strong>Mining Income:</strong> Rewards from mining cryptocurrency</li>
        <li><strong>Staking Rewards:</strong> Income from staking crypto</li>
        <li><strong>Airdrops:</strong> Free crypto received from projects</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Reporting Requirements</h2>
      <p>You must report all cryptocurrency transactions on your tax return. Use Form 8949 to report capital gains and losses, and Schedule D for summary information.</p>
      
      <h2>Record Keeping</h2>
      <p>Maintain detailed records of all transactions including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Date of transaction</li>
        <li>Type of transaction (buy, sell, trade)</li>
        <li>Amount of crypto</li>
        <li>Price per unit</li>
        <li>Total value in USD</li>

      <h2>How Crypto is Taxed</h2>
      <p>The IRS treats cryptocurrency as property for tax purposes. This means each transaction may trigger a taxable event.</p>
      
      <h2>Short-term vs Long-term Capital Gains</h2>
      <p>If you hold crypto for less than one year, gains are taxed as short-term capital gains at your ordinary income tax rate. If held for more than one year, they qualify for long-term capital gains rates, which are typically lower.</p>
      
      <h2>Tax Rates</h2>
      <p>Long-term capital gains rates are 0%, 15%, or 20% depending on your income level. Short-term gains are taxed at your regular income tax rate.</p>
